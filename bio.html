              I am Naresh Markus. I was born on 22 December 1994 in remote part of Gorkha district, Nepal.
              I was not What I am today right from my childhood. I used very kind, generous and shy. I started
              my schooling in a public school,Gorkha.
              I was one of the brightest students. I used to top the class every year. I was so bright that it
               was nearer to impossible for others to beat me in studies.
              I studied till class 6 at that school. Having realised my potentials my father decided to admit me to the private school.
               He brought me to the capital and admitted me to private school. The students of public schools were considered weak in
               English and I was demoted to class 4 from class 6 in private school. My learning skills enhanced within a month though it had
                been difficult in the beginning. I became best even in the new school. I was very innovative at that time. It was everything going well
              till my eighth class. From there a twist came in my life. I started thinking about my life. I started wandering what I will be in future. I was on my teenage and my mind always
              thought beyond studies. I started listening to songs and made that my passion. I thought it was enough, I have done with my studies, I can communicate with others since I have
              learnt English which I thought at that time was enough and it's time I have to Get worried at my career. And the result was I couldn't do much as per my potential by the end of
              secondary level schooling.

              I choose science and technology field in my high school but not by my wish because I was interested to enter the musical field. There also I started ignoring my studies and
              cleared on low grades. Then I did not study for a year. On my family pressure I decided to continue my study and I was confused what to start with. I had a friend at NAMI college
              who advised me to join that college and I did that. I choose BSC (Hons) Computing. I am currently studying at this college. On coming to this college I changed my intentions. I attended
              3 months of bridging classes and some seminars in this college which became sucessful to motivate me towards my studies. Now I am currently studying under the University of Northampton.
              I am at Level 4 now. I am happy with the course contents of this university. I am contunuing my music side by side with my studies. I have now decided to be skilled and then a musician.
              I will become a programmer and apply my skills in musical fields.
